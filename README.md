# AfterLife

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

With introduction of macOS Big Sur Apple stopped to support my MacBook Pro 2012.
This became a good reason to switch to Linux.
Here's my configuration of Manjaro to switch to.




## Installation

- install Manjaro command line version
- `git clone https://github.com/ales-tsurko/afterlife.git`
- `cd afterlife`
- `chmod +x setup.sh`
- `./setup.sh`


### Setup Configuration

You can configure installation by editing the `setup.sh` before run it.
